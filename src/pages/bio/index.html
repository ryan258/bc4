<!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
    <!-- <p class="lead">Many people have lots of metaphors for life.</p>
    <p>Some say it’s a Dream, others insist that it’s a game of luck while others say it’s a journey of blissful highs mixed with treacherous lows.</p>
    <p>The one thing I noticed, is that whatever metaphor a particular person adheres too, it reflects the way they live their life and the choices they make. Personally, I believe life is a set road, all we have to do is travel on it.</p>
    <p class="lead">My road was destined for me.</p>
    <p>I was named after my Dad, Brian Cooper Sr., but most of my fans know me as Bryan Cee which means I provide Conscious Encouragement for everyone through my lyrics and style. </p>
    <p>Every artist is different and naturally so am I. Artists write songs for many different reasons. Most will tell you that it is an expression of their inner most feelings, or maybe a political view of what’s going on in society. Then there are some that write for the hopes of fame, immense wealth and being more attractive to the opposite sex.</p>
    <p>I believe the reason I write is a little more simple or complicated than that, depending how you look at it. I write because it gives me sense of purpose, which is to encourage and inspire people to enjoy their life and seek their own truth and purpose.</p>
    <h2>My Music</h2>
    <p>My music is more of a reflection of my life, which then becomes a dialogue between my mortal humanity and my supernatural spirit. I like to think of it as a form of therapy and the results create balance and harmony in my Universe.</p>
    <p>This is the same for me whether I’m performing or creating. My only Hope is that I can share this bliss with others and maybe it can inspire them to construct their own system to find purpose in their life.</p>
    <h3>The Wibe of life</h3>
    <p>I decided to call my first EP “The Wibe of Life” because I believe my life is a series of “Wibes.”</p>
    <p>For those who are not familiar with the term “Wibe,”  it’s basically a Bahamian term that was coined by my generation which refers to specific situations that impacted change or  were a transition to a new stage.</p>
    <p>It’s a new way of thinking.  It was a term that was vague enough that it can be just about anything but it was also specific enough to comprehend the subject matter. Each song on the album explores the Wibes that I have went through in my life at one point or another.</p>
    <h3>Bush Fusion</h3>
    <p>As an artist and musician, I am influenced by just about everything I listen to or been exposed to. On one hand, I have a love for classical music that has fueled my passion for playing piano.</p>
    <p>I have also been deeply rooted in the local traditions of  goombay, rake’n’scrape  and junkanoo from the Bahamas, since I was a boy growing up in the village of Fox Hill.</p>
    <p>There is also the surge of reggae and dance hall from Jamaica that has taken root in every Caribbean nation.  Not to mention every other music I have been exposed to.</p>
    <p>I always lived my life as  if I was a separate entity, not fitting into any mold or category that was given to me. I have always been a loner but found comfort in being uncomfortable. I thought to myself, “why should my music be any different?”</p>
    <p class="lead">So I coined my own genre and called it Bush fusion.</p>
    <p>It came to me as I was sitting under the mango tree in the front of my house in Fox hill. I was looking at the bush across the street and I found there was sort of an order in the midst of all the chaos between the different species of plants.</p>
    <p>I thought it to be immensely beautiful. Some how God had created a unique garden, which was untouched by man, but displayed an array of color, and sizes. Some trees bore fruit while others had colorful leaves and flowers.</p>
    <p>I remember thinking to myself in that moment, “ I bet there is no other arrangement like this in the entire world”. I was blessed enough to have witnessed it, and others would have to come here to witness it.</p>
    <p>Many will take it for granted but it doesn’t diminish the awesomeness of God and the beauty of his creation.  I saw my life as that bush, and my music was a reflection of that idea. Almost like beautiful Chaos!</p> -->
