      <p>I'm living in the moment<br>
      Enjoying each sensation<br>
      Just wait for a moment girl<br>
      My minds gone on vacation<br>
      There's too much drama in the air<br>
      And I craven some fresh air <br>
      I’ne gone lie i'm not even here<br>
      When i'm gone in the moment<br>
      Everything seem so much nicer<br>
      Sweet music playing<br>
      I know that i found heaven<br>
      Ain't no stress no drama<br>
      Ain't nothing gonna bother me<br>
      Ain't no time like the present time so i'm gonna pop champagne<br>
      Maybe drink some wine</p>

      <p>I'm gone in the moment<br>
      I'm living in the moment<br>
      I'm gone in the moment<br>
      Nothing else important<br>
      But the moment right now<br>
      I'm gone in the moment<br>
      I'm living in the moment<br>
      I'm gone in the moment<br>
      Nothing else important<br>
      But the moment right now</p>

      <p>Everybody needs a break every once in awhile<br>
      So take a deep breath and your mind will smile<br>
      Ain't nothing matter except life and death<br>
      Let me take a moment before i regret<br>
      I think i'm gonna dance instead<br>
      I already made my bed so<br>
      I think i'm gonna dance instead</p>

      But the moment right now<br>
      I'm gone in the moment<br>

      <p>Don't want no body talk to me<br>
      When i'm in my place of peace<br>
      And i'm fighting for my sanity<br>
      Can't you see so let me be<br>
      I need my space and i need my break<br>
      I surely hope you can relate<br>
      (surely hop you can relate)</p>

    <p class="lead">All my life I considered myself to be a loner.</p>
    <p>Not by choice at first but I knew I was different, but I couldn’t explain it.</p>
    <p>I would try to fit in but somehow it seemed the more I try the more epic the fail.</p>
    <p>So I was a loner and over time it became my normal.</p>
    <p>In fact I would say I enjoyed being in my own space better than being with people. I connected with my true self and it felt right.</p>
    <p>Don’t get me wrong, I love people.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy making people feel happy and great about themselves.</p>
    <p>But every so often I must unplug from the social dimension and enter my own truth.</p>
    <p>Everyone should enjoy some alone time. I believe its healthy to always live a balanced life because there is no greater treasure than peace of mind.</p>
