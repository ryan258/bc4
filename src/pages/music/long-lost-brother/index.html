      <p>How high are your mountain tops<br>
      Are your hills to far to climb<br>
      Are you burdened with a broken past<br>
      Do you stand the test of time<br>
      Theres much misunderstanding<br>
      Between ourselves<br>
      Yet we share the same tongue<br>
       Flesh of my flesh<br>
      Blood of my blood<br>
      Only we can prove us wrong</p>
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <p>Oh yes your ways are learned by us<br>
      As the water merges into the sea<br>
      As strangers we loved you<br>
      And cursed as neighbors<br>
      Oh lord when will our minds be free</p>

    <div class="chorus">
      <!-- <p>Chorus:</p> -->
      <p>Long lost brother( long lost brother)<br>
      Where could you be<br>
      Long Lost brother (long lost brother)<br>
      Are you lost in your iniquities<br>
      Long lost brother (long lost brother)<br>
      You been gone for far to long long long<br>
      Long lost brother (long lost brother)<br>
      Just keep holding strong</p>

    <div class="verse">
      <p>We stood shoulder to shoulder on that broken ship<br>
      Wondering if god can ever hear our cries<br>
      without the cooperation of our so demise <br>
      They would have never received the prize<br>
      The rhythm of our hearts extend from the east<br>
      In the garden where our mother doth lie<br>
      And it would bring her great pain if she only knew the truth<br>
      That we sold our souls to pride<br>
       We flex your garments like a thieving crook <br>
      Disregarding it with a conscious mind<br>
      How can we support our brothers as they do themselves<br>
      Cause we think we are someone else</p>

      Are you lost in your iniquities<br>
      Long lost brother (long lost brother)<br>
      You been gone for far too long long long<br>
      Long lost brother (long lost brother)<br>
      Just keep holding strong</p>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
      <p>Is there no peace of mind<br>
      That our lives intertwine<br>
      That we seeking one common goal<br>
      To love one another<br>
      Mother sister and my brother<br>
      Is something we control<br>
      Don't be remist  and how soon we forget<br>
      That through darkness there only shame<br>
      If our heart is the light and we turn in tonight<br>
      Then we only have ourselves to blame</p>

    <p>I released this song back in 2012 as my first single upon arriving back home to the Bahamas after college. I was inspired by my visit to Jamaica and experiencing the vibrancy of the culture and people.</p>
    <p>The Jamaica that I experienced seem to be a time capsule, there were reminders of the past everywhere, which reminded me of how closely connected we are historically and spiritually. I walked on the same paths of the prophet Robert nester Marley and I saw what he saw, I felt his spirit.</p>
    <p>The actual music is reminiscent of the soul of Jamaica with the influence of rock steady rhythms and grooves.  Mean while the lyrics are a message,  not only for Bahamians but everyone of the African diaspora, who has a common history of slavery and are still dealing with the psychological impact it has had on us all, black and white alike.</p>
    <p>My favorite line in the song is <em>“without the cooperation of our so demise, they would have never received the prize.”</em> This shows that humanity is always responsible for the suffering of Humanity.</p>
    <p>The only reason we suffer is because we allow it to happen. We always have the power to change because we always have a choice.  I was compelled to bridge a gap between barriers of geography and culture, doing away with the idea of separation but rather creating a sense of unity and wholeness.</p>
    <p>If we change our mindset, we can experience the world as one creation that is not segregated within itself, focusing on the similarities of the human family and celebrate the uniqueness of our differences.</p>
