    <p class="lead">Have you ever been betrayed?</p>
    <p>People you swore were on the same page only to later realize that they were aiding in your destruction?</p>
    <p>Well let me tell you. It sucks!!</p>
    <p>After my band staged a mutiny, I was totally thrown off. I never even saw it coming...</p>
    <p>One rehearsal we were laughing and enjoying ourselves, then the next week I found myself being verbally attacked whilst
      being insulted for being too ambitious.</p>
    <p>It was one of my lowest moments of my life. I just didn’t understand. Everything was going well. What did they want from
      me?</p>
    <p>Why were they trying to take my joy, my peace, my LIFE?</p>
    <p>It took me a while to realize that they were just afraid and lacked the confidence even though we were pretty good. We
      were just not on the same page at all.</p>
    <p>But when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.</p>
    <p>I was already experimenting with Bush fusion at the time so I turned my frustration into a new project</p>
    <p>It’s ironic that this song has been the toughest to record, but has been a crowd favorite with my new band called The
      Wibesmen.</p>
    <p>Making this EP has been a life changing experience, I made the decision to take a leap of faith to live on purpose.</p>
    <p>Never was afraid of failure because life could only get better. Right?</p>
    <p>So I will believe that my dreams are reality and my best days are ahead.</p>
    <p>I am on a journey that has already been laid for me but I just have to walk it.</p>
    <p>There are many obstacles on the journey but you must be determined enough to push through.</p>
    <p>There is always a way!<br>That’s the wibe right there,<br><strong>the wibe of life!</strong></p>
