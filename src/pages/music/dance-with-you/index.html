      <p>I wanna dance with you girl<br>
      The way you move your waist line<br>
      And i wanna see you move girl<br>
      Bring your body close to mine<br>
      And i want to keep the rhythm<br>
      The way you speed it up and slow it down<br>
      I wanna dance with you girl<br>
      I wanna dance with you<br>
      I wanna dance with you girl</p>

      <p>The music was bumpen and the vibe was fine<br>
      And i was loving myself same time<br>
      When i look into your eyes<br>
      They were staring back at me<br>
      With her skirt above her knees<br>
      And she moven free<br>
      I knew she was a dancehall queen<br>
      And she looked at me<br>
      I knew it was someone iâ€™d like to meet</p>
