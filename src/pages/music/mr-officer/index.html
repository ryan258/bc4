    <p class="lead">“Please Mr. Officer don’t lock me up now...”</p>
    <p>I actually have no problems with the police and have never had any altercations with the law, although I do consider myself a bit rebellious.</p>
    <p>I have always found myself to be against any kind of oppressive authority so I was compelled to write something that was a bit more edgy and controversial that reflected what was going on in the world, especially America.</p>
    <p>However, I cannot take full credit for the song as It was more of a collaboration between a few musicians I met at McNally Smith and Wain Mcfarlin from Ipso Facto.</p>
    <p>The bass line was a pretty popular reggae bassline that we each modified to create this song. I would say there are about two versions of this song that exists now from that collaboration effort.</p>
    <p>In my version, I am basically pleading for a sense of humanity and justice not to be locked up like some animal, in which I don’t even believe animals should be locked up much less human beings.</p>
    <p>Prison and jails don’t work in my opinion. There must be a better way to rehabilitate human beings without degradation and incarceration.</p>
