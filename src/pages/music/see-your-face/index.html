      I'll never forget you<br>
      Your apart of me and i'm apart of you<br>
      There’s no denying this and they know the truth<br>
      And the truth will set you free and you will be with me<br>
      And hey<br>
      I'll be waiting</p>

    <p>Every once in a while life throws us a cold bucket of water. A sobering reality check which you are never prepared for.</p>
    <p>The realization that something is out of our control can be even more debilitating.</p>
    <p>At least it was for me.</p>
    <p>I have always been fond of women and for the most part, they have always been very fond of me. Eventually my fondness got the better of me and what I thought was easily in control became a whirl wind of pure madness.</p>
    <p>A beautiful baby boy was the best fruit our relationship ever produced. Life now had a new flavor and it was so sweet, you just knew nothing would ever be the same again.</p>
    <p>But it wouldn’t last. I sank into the deepest undiscovered layer of the earth’s core only to see my child snatched away from my grasp whisked away to a foreign country.</p>
    <p>This could never work!</p>
    <p>Somethings are out of my control I admit, however, faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains. I’ll choose faith,  I’ll be patient and abide my time</p>
    <p>“Till I see your face again.”</p>
