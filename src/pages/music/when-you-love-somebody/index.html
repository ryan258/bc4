    <p>It might surprise folks that I had anything but love in my heart when I wrote this song.</p>
    <p>I was actually losing at love at the time. I had actually started a mini catalogue of rants about my many misfortunes and deadly encounters that was my love life.</p>
    <p>I realized that my purgatory was quickly becoming hell and I was creating it.</p>
    <p>Just like that I turned it around.</p>
    <p>I wanted to feel like I was in love, the real love. Not the romanticized crap we see on tv but rather that love that words alone couldn’t express. That love which was more than a feeling but rather a knowing.</p>
    <p>That’s the love I desire, that’s the love I want to be in.</p>
    <p>It was my own fantasy that I was sending out to the universe, a sincere request. My heart was empty but I still had my imagination.</p>
    <p>What would it be like to love somebody absolutely and have them love you back?....</p>
    <p>Absolutely!</p>
    <p>I used some Goombay rhythms with some old school soul, which could easily be a duet with the right female voice.</p>
    <p>The passion must be visible, anything else just would not do.</p>
    <p>I think recording this piece had more of an emotional impact on me compared to when I wrote it.</p>
    <p>This song was already riddled with so much of my spirit that once I began to hear the music really come alive in the studio, something moved in me.</p>
    <p>It was like a loving mother giving birth, such a heavy vibration that filled the room that affected everyone, including the engineers.</p>
    <p>I knew we created something that may be bigger than ourselves. That is the point isn’t it?</p>
    <p>To be involved in something greater than our selves.</p>
    <p>When you love somebody speaks to that essence that all humans can relate to and is made from.</p>
    <p>We are all made from and of love.</p>
